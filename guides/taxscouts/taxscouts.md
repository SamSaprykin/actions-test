Once you press 'Next', you will be asked to enter how much profit you made in total.

After this, you will be asked how many cryptocurrency sales transactions you undertook, and whether you reported them using 'Real time capital gains service.'

If you are unsure about your answer to any of these above questions, there is an option to choose "Not sure" or "Don't know" for these questions.

## 5. Assigning an accountant

Now that you have entered your details, you can proceed to the next step where you pay and TaxScouts assign you an accountant to file your tax return. Once this has happened, you will be required to upload some documents to support the tax return.

## 6. Import your Capital Gains Report from CryptoTaxCalculator

Navigate to [CryptoTaxCalculator](https://app.cryptotaxcalculator.io). Once you have logged in, you can navigate to the 'Get Report' section of the page and download your Capital Gains Report as a CSV file. Make sure that all your transactions have been covered in the report. You can then import this file into the TaxScouts website.

Once the CSV file has been uploaded, your accountant will have sufficient information to handle your cryptocurrency taxes. However, you will also need to provide documentation for your other sources of income, e.g. employment. Finally, you can accept the terms of engagement and the accountant will be able to prepare your tax return.
